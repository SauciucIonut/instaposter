# InstaUploader

InstaUploader is a script made in Python that will automatically upload every set hours. It does this by choosing a random photo from a set folder, uploading it then deleting the selected picture. By doing this, the only human interaction is copying pictures into the set folder, and the bot will do its job.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SauciucIonut/instaposter.git
```

## Usage
Set the variables to your desired values and then run:
```bash
python3 instabot.py
```
